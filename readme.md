# To build

```
flet pack .\main.py --icon icon.ico --hidden-import=dbm.dumb
```
- once this finishes move the model folder (omitted on github) into the dist folder

# To install
- download and run this installer: https://tinyurl.com/5n7rhtb6
    - **NOTE**: will obviously be detected as virus since it's a python exe. Simply allow it as a threat once it's quarantined and when running the installer click run anyways

# TODO
- when uploading view misbehaves. possibly related to 1st image or to an empty folder
- speed up startup
    - use larger spacy model
- Known issues. If screen resolution is not 1920 x 1080 or more precisely scaling is non-standard some ui elements are moved and become unusable in the edit_upload

# Dev stuff
- to check if works as binary
```
pyinstaller --hidden-import=dbm.dumb --noconfirm --onefile main.py
```
- btw manually moved model folder into that dir

# Changes
- everything seems to work but need thorough check
- figure out where function out to go im throwing eveything that is used in more than one file or can be general into helper and it's tarting to get crowded
